"Is there a safe temp to leave a dog alone inside a parked car? Not really. It’s best to leave your pet at home where you know he’s safe. If you do need to take your dog along, use common sense and pay close attention to outside temperatures and how long he’s been in the car.",SonomaScanner,953586074751713280,,,Mon Jul 01 06:42:33 +0000 2019
"Another reason why it’s a bad idea to leave the car running is if the engine dies, the cool air or heat goes away. Meanwhile, a dog is put at risk of becoming too hot or too cold while their owner is unaware there’s a problem.",SonomaScanner,953586074751713280,,,Mon Jul 01 06:42:32 +0000 2019
"Leaving the motor running is a bad idea, even if you’ve cracked a window to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning in winter or leave the air conditioning running in the summer. An unrestrained pet can accidentally put the car in gear, which happened in West Virginia.",SonomaScanner,953586074751713280,,,Mon Jul 01 06:42:32 +0000 2019
"As much as a car can heat up in summer temps, it can cool down to under freezing just as fast. Pets that don’t normally spend a lot of time outside in the winter are more susceptible to the cold when left alone inside a vehicle. Hypothermia can become a risk at 50 degrees.",SonomaScanner,953586074751713280,,,Mon Jul 01 06:42:32 +0000 2019
"To understand the heat your pet experiences while waiting in the car, sit in it for 10 to 30 minutes with the windows cracked. Keep in mind, your dog is also wearing a fur coat.",SonomaScanner,953586074751713280,,,Mon Jul 01 06:40:54 +0000 2019
"WHAT TEMP IS SAFE TO LEAVE A DOG IN THE CAR? When the temp is 70° a car can heat up to 89° in 10 min, 104 in 30. At 80° outside, you’re looking at 99° inside in 10 minutes & 114 in 30. At 95° it only takes 10 minutes to reach 114° & the temp soars to 129 degrees in 30 minutes.pic.twitter.com/udic0Y3rJk",SonomaScanner,953586074751713280,,,Mon Jul 01 06:40:32 +0000 2019
